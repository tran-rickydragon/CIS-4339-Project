# CIS-4339-Project
Semester long project for CIS 4339 Enterprise Applications Development. 
Here I have the code from the project since the original repository is private. 

This is a full stack development of a application.
Backend was created with JavaScript and MongoDB to store data. Frontend was created with Vue.js.
