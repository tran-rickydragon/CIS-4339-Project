# CIS-4339-Project
Semester long project for CIS 4339 Enterprise Applications Development.
Here I have the code from the project since the original repository is private. 
My team was tasked with creating an application through full stack development.
Backend was created with JavaScript and MongoDB to store data. Frontend was created with Vue.js.
